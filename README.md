This project is an ESP32 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) server designed to handle multiple device connections simultaneously. It allows clients, such as the nRF Connect mobile app, to read from and write to the ESP32, enabling control of virtual devices like lights and fans. Each connected device is tracked individually, so all interactions—such as writing commands or disconnecting—are logged with the corresponding device number. The project demonstrates features such as continuous advertising, device-specific logging, and reconnect support, making it a solid foundation for IoT applications and smart home projects. Built using ESP-IDF v5.5.1 with the NimBLE stack and FreeRTOS, this BLE server is easy to extend for additional functionality, secure pairing, or integration with mobile and web interfaces.
